*The Player wakes up shocked*
Player: Where am I?
Voice: In the underworld.
Player: This cannot be. Please help me go back
        The item I was transporting is of national importance.
        A world war may break out if it goes missing.
Voice: HUH.., Not again with another World War, the Underworld gets populated
       I will be having a lot of work.
Voice: Fine you human , you will be reincarnated as bot
        Note your life Depends on the bot.
        You will come back to the Underworld if it's destroyed
Player: Thank You!!

*Closes his eyes*
