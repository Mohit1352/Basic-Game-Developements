# Basic Game Developments
 Two of my projects from the time of my degree course, made to perfect coding skills.

There are developments in C/C++ and Python.

C/C++ is slightly outdated as it is programmed to run with the old Borland Turbo C++. However, it is a game of sudoku - its mechanism is a bit broken.

The python development consists of a Tkinter based window creator with interactive, colour changing buttons and also with sound. Basically a combination of window management and backend, that allow one to play, save and load basic text based games with some control over background music. No animations whatsoever.

Since the python code just reads a file for the story, one just needs an elaborate story, better colour schemes, better music, and this software will combine it all to give a good experience.
